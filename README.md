## Importance of XML to CSV Conversion

XML files are widely used for data storage and transfer due to their flexibility and ability to represent complex hierarchical data structures. However, for researchers and data analysts, working with XML files can be challenging due to their complexity and lack of compatibility with many data analysis tools. Converting XML to CSV makes the data more accessible and easier to manipulate with common data analysis software like Excel, R, and Python.

This app not only provides a comprehensive analysis of Apple Watch data but also serves as an XML to CSV converter, making it a valuable tool for researchers who need to transform their data into a more usable format for analysis.
